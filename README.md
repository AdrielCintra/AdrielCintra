# Hi there, my name is Adriel 👋

## Welcome to my Github profile! 😄

- I have a degree in business administration and am currently pursuing an MBA in business management (Lato Sensu). Both at Uni-FACEF - Centro Universit´rio de Franca.
- Although I really enjoy business administration, I felt something was missing, so I decided to transition into tech and ended up finding myself through programming.
- Currently diving into tech, studying programming logic with JavaScript and Java through Alura.

## 💬 Aboute me:

- I’m 25 years old and from Franca, a small city in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.
- As the son of a shop owner, I grew up working in my family’s supermarket. There, I learned everything about commerce and retail, taking on multiple responsibilities and developing strong management and leadership skills.
- Beyond that, I worked for almost two years at Magazine Luiza, one of the largest companies in Brazil. I was part of the administrative area of one of their holdings, where I strengthened my teamwork skills, learned a lot about corporate culture, and developed a more analytical mindset.
- Despite my experience in administration, I felt unfulfilled and decided to seek career guidance. After several sessions and profile analyses, I discovered the world of technology — and immediately connected with it.
- Since then, I’ve been on a journey to learn, grow, and gain experience, aiming to build a career in the tech industry.
